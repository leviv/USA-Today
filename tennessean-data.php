  <p>The veteran’s legs are curled up as he uses a blue blanket as a makeshift pillow.</p>

  <p>According to his sister, Gail Hobbs, they’ve been waiting eight hours for him to be placed on a bed and admitted for care at the Alvin C. York VA Medical Center in Murfreesboro.</p>

  <p>“He can’t even walk,” Hobbs posted along with the photo on Facebook on Friday. “He deserves better treatment. He served his country.”</p>

  <p>The post has been shared more than 230,000 times — many sent directly to President Donald Trump on Twitter — and picked up by multiple veteran watchdog pages.</p>

  <p>But Tennessee Valley Healthcare System says their review of the photo determined that "the facts are much different than what’s presented.”</p>

  <p>VA spokesman Chris Vadnais told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee that officials first learned of the photo Friday night and immediately started an investigation.</p>

  <p>Officials reviewed Mims\' medical records and found he was admitted to Murfreesboro VA on Thursday, the day before the photo was posted online, Vadnais said</p>

  <p>“Mims is now an inpatient in our facility and he is being well taken care of. Our medical center director has visited the patient and has his assurance that he received good care and has no complaints,” Vadnais said.</p>

  <p>Hobbs and Mims could not be reached for comment. But Hobbs posted one last update for the thousands now following her post Monday morning.</p>

  <p>She wrote that "the head of veterans affairs came in from Washington," on Sunday regarding her brother\'s case.</p>

  <p>"He is now getting good care," she replied to a commenter.</p>

  <p><span class="link">Murfreesboro VA remains among the most poorly rated veterans hospitals</span> in the country. Their <span class="link">average wait time for new patients</span> seeking primary care appointments is 26 days, according to the VA website.</p>

  <h4>Why we’re doing this story:</h4>

  <p>Stories that go viral on social media are often one-sided. It’s up to journalists to do the work of providing a more complete, fairer account.</p>

  <h4>How we reported this story:</h4>

  <p>A whistleblower source from another VA hospital in Tennessee alerted us to the post from the veteran’s family. Although family members were continuing to update their story on social media, they never responded to our request for an interview. We also contacted the VA, and our reporting is based on their records and interviews with their staff.</p>

  <h4>How we took steps to be fair:</h4>

  <p>Each side of a story like this deserves the chance to speak. After we collected the VA’s account of the incident, we got back in touch with the veteran’s family to see if they wanted to confirm or dispute any of the information. They chose not to respond, so our story is based on our reporting with the VA and on what the veteran’s family has posted publicly.</p>';
